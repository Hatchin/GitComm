# Git Gui

 Alternative to the command line

[GitKaren](https://support.gitkraken.com/how-to-install): beautiful GUI 

[SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/): Free enterprise-grade tool

## 1. Download
SourceTree could be downloaded from the link above. It would need some time (SourceTree made me download .Net first and it was a long process). 

## 2. Setup
Setting up requires login and you could registrate an account at that page. 

# 3. Connect GitHub to SourceTree
`Tools`->`option`->`Authentication`->`Add (under Account panel)`, then choose `GitHub` as the Hosting Service, then click `Refresh Oauth Token`.
